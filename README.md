Titled the website Horiseon so it would appear as such in the browser tab, letting you know the context within the tab.

Added reset.CSS.cdn link on line 7 to normalize the CSS to increase accessibility on all browsers. 

Since there were three similar styles for different elements, I combined the elements under one class on line 89 to reduce code / file size. 

Same goes for the "lead / brand / cost elements." Combined together on line 94 under an h3 class since it was the only h3 on the page, to further simplify and condense. 

Again on line 117. Combined the elements under one class, seeing that the design is similar for all three elements.
